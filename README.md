## Here are the steps to run the pipeline

Step 1: Create a new Jenkins job

Log in to your Jenkins instance.
Click on "New Item" in the top left corner.
Choose "Pipeline" as the job type.
Name your job (e.g., "DevOps Pipeline").
Click "OK" to create the job.

Step 2: Configure the Jenkins job

In the job configuration page, scroll down to the "Pipeline" section.
Click on "Pipeline" and then click on "Source Code Management".
Select "Git" as the source control management system.
Enter the URL of your Git repository (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git).
Click "Save" to save the changes.

Step 3: Create a new Git repository

Create a new Git repository on your local machine or on a remote server (e.g., GitHub).
Initialize the repository with a git init command.
Add the pipeline files (.jenkinsfile, ansible/deploy.yml, docker/Dockerfile, etc.) to the repository.
Commit the changes with a git commit command.

Step 4: Run the pipeline

Go back to the Jenkins job configuration page.
Click on "Build Now" to run the pipeline.
The pipeline will execute the stages defined in the .jenkinsfile.
You can monitor the pipeline execution by clicking on the "Console Output" link.

Step 5: Verify the deployment

Once the pipeline has completed, verify that the application has been deployed successfully.
Check the AWS EC2 instance to ensure that it's running and accessible.
Verify that the Docker container is running and the application is accessible.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to run the pipeline and deploy your application to AWS using Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, and Terraform.
